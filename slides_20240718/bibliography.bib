	abstract = {We developed a solar flare prediction model using a deep neural network (DNN) named Deep Flare Net (DeFN). This model can calculate the probability of flares occurring in the following 24 hr in each active region, which is used to determine the most likely maximum classes of flares via a binary classification (e.g., ≥M class versus &lt;M class or ≥C class versus &lt;C class). From 3 × 105 observation images taken during 2010--2015 by the Solar Dynamic Observatory, we automatically detected sunspots and calculated 79 features for each region, to which flare occurrence labels of X-, M-, and C-class were attached. We adopted the features used in Nishizuka et al. (2017) and added some features for operational prediction: coronal hot brightening at 131 {\AA} (T ≥ 107 K) and the X-ray and 131 {\AA} intensity data 1 and 2 hr before an image. For operational evaluation, we divided the database into two for training and testing: the data set in 2010--2014 for training, and the one in 2015 for testing. The DeFN model consists of deep multilayer neural networks formed by adapting skip connections and batch normalizations. To statistically predict flares, the DeFN model was trained to optimize the skill score, i.e., the true skill statistic (TSS). As a result, we succeeded in predicting flares with TSS = 0.80 for ≥M-class flares and TSS = 0.63 for ≥C-class flares. Note that in usual DNN models, the prediction process is a black box. However, in the DeFN model, the features are manually selected, and it is possible to analyze which features are effective for prediction after evaluation.},

@article{nishizuka2021oper,
	abstract = {We developed an operational solar flare prediction model using deep neural networks, named Deep Flare Net (DeFN). DeFN can issue probabilistic forecasts of solar flares in two categories, such as ≥M-class and < M-class events or ≥C-class and < C-class events, occurring in the next 24 h after observations and the maximum class of flares occurring in the next 24 h. DeFN is set to run every 6 h and has been operated since January 2019. The input database of solar observation images taken by the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) is downloaded from the data archive operated by the Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) of Stanford University. Active regions are automatically detected from magnetograms, and 79 features are extracted from each region nearly in real time using multiwavelength observation data. Flare labels are attached to the feature database, and then, the database is standardized and input into DeFN for prediction. DeFN was pretrained using the datasets obtained from 2010 to 2015. The model was evaluated with the skill score of the true skill statistics (TSS) and achieved predictions with TSS = 0.80 for ≥M-class flares and TSS = 0.63 for ≥C-class flares. For comparison, we evaluated the operationally forecast results from January 2019 to June 2020. We found that operational DeFN forecasts achieved TSS = 0.70 (0.84) for ≥C-class flares with the probability threshold of 50 (40){\%}, although there were very few M-class flares during this period and we should continue monitoring the results for a longer time. Here, we adopted a chronological split to divide the database into two for training and testing. The chronological split appears suitable for evaluating operational models. Furthermore, we proposed the use of time-series cross-validation. The procedure achieved TSS = 0.70 for ≥M-class flares and 0.59 for ≥C-class flares using the datasets obtained from 2010 to 2017. Finally, we discuss the standard evaluation methods for operational forecasting models, such as the preparation of observation, training, and testing datasets, and the selection of verification metrics.},

@article{leka2019acomII,
	abstract = {Solar flares are extremely energetic phenomena in our solar system. Their impulsive and often drastic radiative increases, particularly at short wavelengths, bring immediate impacts that motivate solar physics and space weather research to understand solar flares to the point of being able to forecast them. As data and algorithms improve dramatically, questions must be asked concerning how well the forecasting performs; crucially, we must ask how to rigorously measure performance in order to critically gauge any improvements. Building upon earlier-developed methodology of Paper I (Barnes et al. 2016), international representatives of regional warning centers and research facilities assembled in 2017 at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Japan to, for the first time, directly compare the performance of operational solar flare forecasting methods. Multiple quantitative evaluation metrics are employed, with the focus and discussion on evaluation methodologies given the restrictions of operational forecasting. Numerous methods performed consistently above the ``no-skill'' level, although which method scored top marks is decisively a function of flare event definition and the metric used; there was no single winner. Following in this paper series, we ask why the performances differ by examining implementation details (Leka et al. 2019), and then we present a novel analysis method to evaluate temporal patterns of forecasting errors in Paper IV (Park et al. 2019). With these works, this team presents a well-defined and robust methodology for evaluating solar flare forecasting methods in both research and operational frameworks and today's performance benchmarks against which improvements and new methods may be compared.},

@article{leka2019acomIII,
	abstract = {A workshop was recently held at Nagoya University (2017 October 31--November 2), sponsored by the Center for International Collaborative Research, at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Japan, to quantitatively compare the performance of today's operational solar flare forecasting facilities. Building upon Paper I of this series, in Paper II we described the participating methods for this latest comparison effort, the evaluation methodology, and presented quantitative comparisons. In this paper, we focus on the behavior and performance of the methods when evaluated in the context of broad implementation differences. Acknowledging the short testing interval available and the small number of methods available, we do find that forecast performance: (1) appears to improve by including persistence or prior flare activity, region evolution, and a human ``forecaster in the loop''; (2) is hurt by restricting data to disk-center observations; (3) may benefit from long-term statistics but mostly when then combined with modern data sources and statistical approaches. These trends are arguably weak and must be viewed with numerous caveats, as discussed both here and in Paper II. Following this present work, in Paper IV (Park et al. 2019) we will present a novel analysis method to evaluate temporal patterns of forecasting errors of both types (i.e., misses and false alarms). Hence, most importantly, with this series of papers, we demonstrate the techniques for facilitating comparisons in the interest of establishing performance-positive methodologies.},

We show that non-degenerate limit laws exist for M-estimates if the loss function is sufficiently smooth; these results remain valid if location and scale are also estimated. For least absolute deviation (LAD) estimates, similar results hold under conditions on the innovations distribution near 0. We also discuss, under moment conditions on the innovations, consistency properties for M-estimators corresponding to the class of loss functions, ϱ(x) = {\textbar}x {\textbar}γ for some γ {\textgreater} 0.},
